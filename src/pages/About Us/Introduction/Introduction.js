                        <h1>Introduction to Wiser Sport</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Wiser sport originated as the most prestigious ball sport played in ancient palaces and
                            royal courts by emperors, kings, ministers, scholar-officials and Western heads of state in
                            order to cultivate the ability to strategize, exercise the body, and engage in a battle of
                            wits. Unfortunately, with the passage of time, this diversion enjoyed worldwide by emperors,
                            kings, and prime ministers has long since become a lost sport.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, a magnificent, selfless, elder virtuous one has now rediscovered and perfected the
                            Wiser sport for the benefit of the public. This elder virtuous one is the one of noble moral
                            character. In its 112th Congress, the United States Senate passed through unanimous consent
                            resolution 614, which commended the elder virtuous one for the contributions he has made to
                            humanity. When the elder virtuous one taught all of the techniques and rules of the Wiser
                            sport to World Wiser Sport Committee, he solemnly stated, “You must spread the Wiser sport
                            all over the world and become the headquarters that leads the Wiser sport. Remember, no
                            matter if one is male or female, old or young—everyone has the right to enjoy Wiser. That is
                            because Wiser is purely a ball sport that nature has bestowed upon humanity to strengthen
                            the body and improve health. Everyone has the equal right to enjoy it. Its only purpose is
                            to benefit humanity through strengthening the body, improving health, elevating morality,
                            increasing friendship, and promoting peace in the world.” The World Wiser Sport Committee
                            has now been formally established, with its headquarters located in the United States, the
                            founding nation of the Wiser sport.{" "}
                            <a src="/">
                                The inauguration ceremony for installing the World Wiser Sport Committee’s first-term
                                leadership was held in the United States on March 2, 2013.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Wiser is a ball sport in which strategy and exercise are combined, and motion and stillness
                            vie with each other, all in a setting where teams compete against each other. A special
                            playing field is not required. It can be played in any area, no matter how many obstacles
                            there may be. It is extremely safe and suitable for everyone—male, female, old, and young
                            can play it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is an unfortunate fact that some elderly people are not in good health. They may even
                            suffer from limb numbness, which makes it difficult for them to walk. Some have cognitive
                            and memory issues that can impair their ability to function in life. Yet, as long as elderly
                            people are able to play Wiser, the Wiser sport can help them improve their immunity,
                            strengthen their body, enhance their stamina, enliven exhausted brain cells, avoid senile
                            dementia, broaden and ease their mind, increase their happiness, prevent rheumatism and
                            chilliness, and avoid loneliness, insomnia, and numbness of the limbs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Middle-aged and young people can likewise reap these benefits. Through playing Wiser, they
                            can enhance their wisdom and develop their mental vitality. In addition, playing Wiser can
                            resolve the tendency of homebound men and women to be solitary, eccentric, and asocial. That
                            is because involvement in Wiser will provide them with opportunities to go outdoors, make
                            friends during matches, increase their self-confidence, and develop wholesome social
                            relations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Moreover, teenagers and children who play Wiser will become better at thinking independently
                            and will be more courteous and virtuous. They will develop tenacity, physical strength, and
                            intelligence. It is the best sport for rearing people of talent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In short, playing the Wiser sport not only builds physical strength, but also develops
                            wisdom and brainpower. It does not matter if the player is old, middle-aged, young, a
                            teenager, a child, male, or female. No special playing field is required. An appropriate
                            playing field could be set up based on the conditions that exist at the particular site.
                            Different types of playing fields and various irregularly shaped obstacles are not only part
                            of the setting of the sport, but they even provide the key to opening wisdom. Clever
                            planning and intelligence spring from the minds of players as myriad changes take place
                            during the course of a game. Variations in playing fields and changes in obstacles add new
                            challenges for the players. Even if one plays at the same playing field all the time, since
                            each match is unique in terms of its sequence, line, direction, and strength of attacks
                            initiated by members of one’s own team and the other team, there is never any repetition
                            among different matches. Each match requires the application of different layout and attack
                            techniques. All of this enables players to improve their wisdom, sharpen their sport skills,
                            and experience the delight of extraordinary variety. This is a characteristic of Wiser that
                            all other ball sports lack. A congratulation letter to the World Wiser Sport Committee from
                            the International Olympic Committee and the International Boxing Association
                            enthusiastically praised the Wiser sport as “the most ideal sport of all the ball sports.”
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Moreover, playing the Wiser sport is extremely safe. Anyone who likes to exercise, wants to
                            strengthen both body and mind, and wants to build moral character can play this sport. It is
                            a sport that truly treats everyone equally. It entails both individual and group strategies
                            and tactics. From the perspective of developing one’s intelligence and thought processes,
                            the Wiser sport is like organizing battle formations in war or playing chess. From the
                            perspective of exercising the body and increasing one’s physical strength, it is a perfect,
                            natural, engaging ball sport. Thus, Wiser is the perfect ball sport for athletes and
                            non-athletes worldwide.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Generally speaking, Wiser has the following seven types of beneficial effects: strengthening
                            the body and improving health, enlivening the spirit, developing brainpower and wisdom,
                            increasing unity and friendliness, improving the body’s immunity, delaying the decline of
                            stamina, and helping to elevate moral character. Experience has shown that everyone who has
                            played the Wiser ball game praises it and wants to keep playing it, for it has clearly given
                            them a healthier body and mind.
